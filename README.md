PDNAPred: Interpretable Prediction of Protein-DNA Binding Sites based on Pre-trained Protein Language Model 
Lingrong Zhang, Taigang Liu

Abstractï¼šProtein-DNA interactions are pivotal in various biological processes and further guide drug discovery. However, traditional experimental methods are laborious and unable to keep pace with the growing volume of protein sequences, leading to a substantial number of proteins lacking DNA-binding annotations. Therefore, developing an efficient and accurate computational method for identifying protein-DNA binding sites is imperative. In this study, we introduce PDNAPred, a novel deep learning method designed to identify DNA-binding sites within protein sequences accurately. PDNAPred leverages pre-trained protein language models ESM-2 and ProtT5 to generate enhanced representations of protein sequences autonomously. Our designed CNN-GRU network effectively captures subtle features associated with DNA-binding sites, resulting in improved identification accuracy. To address data imbalance, we employ the focal loss as the loss function during training. Through comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art models on widely used benchmark datasets, the PDNAPred demonstrates outstanding performance. It surpasses sequence-based methods and achieves comparable results to structure-based methods. Furthermore, PDNAPred exhibits commendable performance on RNA binding site identification tasks, showcasing its versatility in identifying amino acid binding sites in proteins. The interpretability analysis provides insight into PDNAPred's internal workings, enhancing its credibility. With superior computational efficiency and speed, PDNAPred is suitable for large-scale binding site prediction tasks.
